# CodeClause_sentiment-analysis_keshu
Python sentiment analysis is a methodology for analyzing a piece of text to discover the sentiment hidden within it. It accomplishes this by combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).I committed this project during my CodeClause internship.

In this machine learning project, I built a binary text classifier to classify the sentiment behind the text. And used the various NLP preprocessing techniques to clean the data and utilize the LSTM layers to build the text classifier.

DATASET:The dataset contains more than 14000 tweets data samples classified into 3 types: positive, negative, neutral.

Steps invloved in this advanced Python project:

1.Data Preprocessing

2.Build the Text Classifier

3.Train the sentiment analysis model

4.Test the model and execute.
